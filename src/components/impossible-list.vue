                This was an idea that i take from Thomas Frank. Probably you know the term of a bucket list, a list of things you wanted to do before you die. A list that could contain a journey you have postpone
                for different reason or a goal to read 15 books a year. But this list probably hasnÂ´t been part of an active role in your life. An impossible list makes you want to pursuit this goals, dreams or objectives
                in an active way, keeping you accountable and remind you of the the things you set for yourself.
                I recommend this video about it, for more explanation about the concept.

            Current Focuses:

                Right now my main focus is in the couple of projects for my personal interest. That will help in not only programming proficiency, but also
                in project management.
